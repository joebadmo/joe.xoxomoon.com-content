## about

Hi. I'm Joe.

I live in a little, old house in Portland, Oregon with my lovely wife Bev and
our children, Zeke and Bea.

I'm a "software" "engineer" for [AppNexus, Inc](http://www.appnexus.com/).

Like any good Portlander, I enjoy drinking good coffee, eating good food, and
commuting by bicycle.

In my free time I try to read, write (both prose and code), and climb rocks.

### bio

I was in the US Marine Corps Infantry. I served two tours in Iraq, and one in
the West Pacific.

After that, I earned my B.A. in Comparative Literature from the University of
Washington in Seattle on the Montgomery GI Bill.

### about this site

I built this site with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/).

## code

I've been writing code for at least several weeks now. I have an opinion about
punctuation in JavaScript.

[This](https://github.com/sodiumjoe/dotfiles) is my dotfiles repo. There are
many like it but this one is mine.

I generally work in [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) in a
[tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) session running in
[Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) in [Alacritty](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty) on
a Mac.

## prose

### technology

I write about various (mostly nerdy) things on my [blog](/blog).

I've also somehow managed to get a few pieces published on [The Atlantic's
Technology Channel](http://www.theatlantic.com/joe-moon/).

### homework

As a Comparative Literature major, I did a lot of writing. [Here](/prose)'s some
of it.

### war

I kept a blog during most of my enlistment as a U.S. Marine Corps infantryman.

I collected posts from my second deployment
[here](http://servicerecordbook.com).

The final entry was published in the University of Washington Comparative
History of Ideas Department Publication The Anthology Project ([June
2007](https://depts.washington.edu/chid/The_Anthology_Project/2007/)).
