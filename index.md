## about

<div class="row">

<div class="six columns">

<p>Hi. I&#8217;m Joe.</p>

<p>I live in a little, old house in Portland, Oregon with my lovely wife Bev and our son Zeke.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a &#8220;software&#8221; &#8220;engineer&#8221; for <a href="http://www.appnexus.com/">AppNexus, Inc.</a></p>

<p>Like any good Portlander, I enjoy drinking good coffee, eating well, and commuting by bicycle.</p>

<p>In my free time I try to read, write (both prose and code), and climb rocks whenever I can.</p>

### bio

I was born in Seoul, S. Korea, but immigrated to the US at two months old.

In September of 2002, I enlisted in the US Marine Corps Infantry. I served two tours in Iraq, and one in the West Pacific.

I earned my B.A. in Comparative Literature from the University of Washington in Seattle on the Montgomery GI Bill.

### about this site

I built this site with Clojure and ClojureScript.

## code

I've been writing code for at least several weeks now. I have an opinion about punctuation in JavaScript.

[This](https://github.com/joebadmo/dotfiles) is my dotfiles repo. There are many like it but this one is mine.

I generally work in [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) in a [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) session running in [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) in [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home) on a Mac.

## prose

### technology

I write about various (mostly nerdy) things on my [blog](/blog).

I've also somehow managed to get a few pieces published on [The Atlantic's Technology Channel](http://www.theatlantic.com/joe-moon/).

### homework

As a Comparative Literature major, I did a lot of writing. Here's some of it:

### war

I kept a blog during most of my enlistment as a U.S. Marine Corps infantryman.

I collected posts from my second deployment [here](http://servicerecordbook.com).

The final entry was published in the University of Washington Comparative History of Ideas Department Publication The Anthology Project ([June 2007](https://depts.washington.edu/chid/The_Anthology_Project/2007/)).
