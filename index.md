<p class="lead">Just your typical preterite* immigrant combat veteran with a literature degree.</p>

<small>* In Pynchon's religious sense, not the grammatical one.</small>

Hi. I'm Joe.

I live in a Portland, Oregon with my wife Bev and our kids, Zeke and Bea.

I'm a "software" "engineer" for [AppNexus, Inc.](http://www.appnexus.com/)

Like any good Portlander, I drinking good coffee, eating good food, and riding my bicycle to work.

In my free time I try to read, write (both prose and code), and climb rocks whenever I can.

### bio

I was born in Seoul, S. Korea, but immigrated to the US at two months old.

In September of 2002, I enlisted in the US Marine Corps Infantry. I served two tours in Iraq, and one in the West Pacific.

I earned my B.A. in Comparative Literature from the University of Washington in Seattle on the Montgomery GI Bill.

### about this site

I built this site with [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/).

## code

I've been writing code for at least several weeks now. I have an opinion about punctuation in JavaScript.

[This](https://github.com/sodiumjoe/dotfiles) is my dotfiles repo. There are many like it but this one is mine.

I generally work in [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) in a [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) session running in [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) in [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home) on a Mac.

## prose

### technology

I write about various (mostly nerdy) things on my [blog](/blog).

I've also somehow managed to get a few pieces published on [The Atlantic's Technology Channel](http://www.theatlantic.com/joe-moon/).

### homework

As a Comparative Literature major, I did a lot of writing. Here's some of it:

* *Problems in the Publication of In-Flight Magazines* &mdash; [January 2009](/prose/magazines) <br />
  Reflective essay on internship experience at a small publishing company.
* *A Hospital Visit* &mdash; [June 2008](/prose/hospital) <br />
  Final paper for a Narrative Journalism course, winner of the Deb Kaplan Narrative Journalism Award 2008 for "Story that Illuminates an Important Public Issue."
* *Achilles' Armor and Identity in The Iliad* &mdash; [March 2008](/prose/achilles) <br />
  Final paper for an Epic Tradition course.
* *Concrete and Abstract Adaptation in* Adaptation &mdash; [September 2007](/prose/adaptation) <br />
  Critical essay on the film *Adaptation* ([2002](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268126/)).

### war

I kept a blog during most of my enlistment as a U.S. Marine Corps infantryman.

I collected posts from my second deployment [here](http://servicerecordbook.com).

The final entry was published in the University of Washington Comparative History of Ideas Department Publication The Anthology Project ([June 2007](https://depts.washington.edu/chid/The_Anthology_Project/2007/)).
