Hi. I'm Joe.

I live in a little, old house in Portland, Oregon with my lovely wife Bev and our son Zeke.

I'm a "software" "engineer" for [AppNexus, Inc.](http://www.appnexus.com/).

Like any good Portlander, I enjoy drinking good coffee, eating well, and commuting by bicycle.

In my free time I try to read, write (both prose and code), and climb rocks whenever I can.

#### bio

I was born in Seoul, S. Korea, but immigrated to the US at two months old.

In September of 2002, I enlisted in the US Marine Corps Infantry. I served two tours in Iraq, and one in the West Pacific.

I earned my B.A. in Comparative Literature from the University of Washington in Seattle on the Montgomery GI Bill.

#### about this site

I built this site with Clojure and ClojureScript.
