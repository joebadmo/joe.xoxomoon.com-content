<section id='about'><p class="lead">Hi. I'm Joe.</p>

I live in a little, old house in Portland, Oregon with my lovely wife Bev and our son Zeke.

I'm a "software" "engineer" for <a href="http://www.appnexus.com/">AppNexus, Inc.</a>

Like any good Portlander, I enjoy drinking good coffee, eating well, and commuting by bicycle.

  <p>In my free time I try to read, write (both prose and code), and climb rocks whenever I can.</p>

  <h4>bio</h4>

  <p>I was born in Seoul, S. Korea, but immigrated to the US at two months old.</p>

  <p>In September of 2002, I enlisted in the US Marine Corps Infantry. I served two tours in Iraq, and one in the West Pacific.</p>

  <p>I earned my B.A. in Comparative Literature from the University of Washington in Seattle on the Montgomery GI Bill.</p>

  <h2>prose</h2>

  <h4>technology</h4>

  <p>I write about various (mostly nerdy) things on my <a href="/blog">blog</a>.</p>

  <p>I've also somehow managed to get a few pieces published on <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/joe-moon/">The Atlantic's Technology Channel</a>.</p>

  <h4>homework</h4>

  <p>As a Comparative Literature major, I did a lot of writing. Here's some of it:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Problems in the Publication of In-Flight Magazines</em> &mdash; <a href="/prose/magazines">January 2009</a> <br />
      Reflective essay on internship experience at a small publishing company.</li>

    <li><em>A Hospital Visit</em> &mdash; <a href="/prose/hospital">June 2008</a> <br />
      Final paper for a Narrative Journalism course, winner of the Deb Kaplan Narrative Journalism Award 2008 for "Story that Illuminates an Important Public Issue."</li>

    <li><em>Achilles' Armor and Identity in The Iliad</em> &mdash; <a href="/prose/achilles">March 2008</a> <br />
      Final paper for an Epic Tradition course.</li>

    <li><em>Concrete and Abstract Adaptation in</em> Adaptation &mdash; <a href="/prose/adaptation">September 2007</a> <br />
      Critical essay on the film <em>Adaptation</em> (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268126/">2002</a>).</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>war</h4>

  <p>I kept a blog during most of my enlistment as a U.S. Marine Corps infantryman.</p>

  <p>I collected posts from my second deployment <a href="http://servicerecordbook.com">here</a>.</p>

  <p>The final entry was published in the University of Washington Comparative History of Ideas Department Publication The Anthology Project (<a href="https://depts.washington.edu/chid/The_Anthology_Project/2007/">June 2007</a>).</p>

  <h2>code</h2>

  <p>I've been writing code for at least several weeks now. I have an opinion about punctuation in JavaScript.</p>

  <p><a href="https://github.com/joebadmo/dotfiles">This</a> is my dotfiles repo. There are many like it but this one is mine.</p>

  <p>I generally work in <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> in a <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/">tmux</a> session running in <a href="http://www.zsh.org/">Zsh</a> in <a href="http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home">iTerm2</a> on a Mac.</p>
