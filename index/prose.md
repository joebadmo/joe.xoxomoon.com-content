#### technology

I write about various (mostly nerdy) things on my [blog](/blog).

I've also somehow managed to get a few pieces published on [The Atlantic's Technology Channel](http://www.theatlantic.com/joe-moon/).

#### homework

As a Comparative Literature major, I did a lot of writing. Here's some of it:

<ul>
  <li><em>Problems in the Publication of In-Flight Magazines</em> &mdash; <a href="/prose/magazines">January 2009</a> <br />
    Reflective essay on internship experience at a small publishing company.</li>

  <li><em>A Hospital Visit</em> &mdash; <a href="/prose/hospital">June 2008</a> <br />
    Final paper for a Narrative Journalism course, winner of the Deb Kaplan Narrative Journalism Award 2008 for "Story that Illuminates an Important Public Issue."</li>

  <li><em>Achilles' Armor and Identity in The Iliad</em> &mdash; <a href="/prose/achilles">March 2008</a> <br />
    Final paper for an Epic Tradition course.</li>

  <li><em>Concrete and Abstract Adaptation in</em> Adaptation &mdash; <a href="/prose/adaptation">September 2007</a> <br />
    Critical essay on the film <em>Adaptation</em> (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268126/">2002</a>).</li>
</ul>

#### war

I kept a blog during most of my enlistment as a U.S. Marine Corps infantryman.

I collected posts from my second deployment [here](http://servicerecordbook.com).

The final entry was published in the University of Washington Comparative History of Ideas Department Publication The Anthology Project ([June 2007](https://depts.washington.edu/chid/The_Anthology_Project/2007/)).
